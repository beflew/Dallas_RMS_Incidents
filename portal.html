      <p>Not only do good records provide crucial internal information, law enforcement agencies now could communicate agency-to-agency and across continents based on these records and reports in order to protect the Nation's citizens. Nothing is more important to accomplishing that mission than having accessibility to accurate and timely records. </p>

		<p>Our team focus on the RMS--Records Management System of incidents reporting in America. A RMS consisting of uniform records in incident/offense reports is extremely beneficial for law enforcement agencies, which satisfies operational and management needs at the local level, as well as the informational requirements of the UCR Program(Uniform Crime Reports) for FBI.</p>

		<p>The intended audience for this visualization will be primarily people who want to know which area in Dallas has less incidents of a specific type, which potentially indicates the safeness of that area, though perhaps additionally for the more specific subsets of governments, insurance companies, etc.</p>
